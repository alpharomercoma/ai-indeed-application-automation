    "description": "**About On Me  \n  \n**Humans have given each other gifts since the dawn of time. For gratitude, for friendship, and for love. In today’s society, gifting has become harder and much more wasteful, as it’s become nearly impossible to know exactly what someone wants, when you just want to show that you care.  \n  \nOn Me is revolutionizing gifting by rebuilding it for the mobile and Instagram era. Traditional gift cards are impersonal and rigid, usually sold by an old and wealthy megacorp. We make it easy to send a personalized, media-rich gift that’s spendable across brands, fits someone’s hobbies, and drops straight into their mobile wallet for tap‑to‑pay. Check out our live experience at onme.com.  \n  \nWe’re a small startup from Google and Apple moving fast on a massive category and have **raised $8M from top‑tier investors like NFX, Lerer Hippeau, Focal VC, and Mastercard**. Since launching in November 2024, On Me has been featured in Tech Crunch, Fortune, and The Wall Street Journal. In 2025, we sustained over 40% growth month over month throughout the year, and the trend shows no sign of stopping.  \n  \nIn 2026, we’re doubling down on making every gift feel magical end‑to‑end and building an amazing consumer product. You’ll help us build a world-class web platform and mobile apps that people love. If you want meaningful ownership, clear consumer product impact, and the chance to set engineering standards early, this is it.  \n  \n**Who You Are  \n  \n**You’re perfect for this role if you want to own your work end to end and make company-wide decisions across product, frontend, and backend. You love working on features that touch real users, from the pixels and flows they see to the systems and data powering everything underneath. You care about the quality and craft of what you do, and why you do it.  \n  \n**What You’ll Do  \n  \n**As a full stack software engineer, you’ll be the fourth engineer at a tiny startup, working closely with the whole team to design and build the end‑to‑end product experiences that power our gifting platform. You’ll own projects that span our web app, iOS and Android Apps, and the backend services behind them. You’ll be responsible for building polished, performant UIs; designing clean APIs; and wiring everything up to resilient systems that can safely handle millions of dollars in transactions. Your work will include thinking through user journeys, edge cases, loading and error states, while also architecting systems for availability, performance, and security.
